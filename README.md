a practice project to attempt to write something a bit bigger

many inspiration on how to structure the code was taken from expressjs and [DiscordLuau](https://github.com/DiscordLuau/discord-luau), though, it's still messy

my dream is to see this library being minimalistic and at the same time batteries included, and, of course, finished
